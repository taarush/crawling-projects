My python scripts , which i code for fun!
-----------------------------------------
results.py

This python script was coded to download state-wide 12th grade (HS Senior year) examination results from an online results website. First we need a website which gives out results solely based on hall-ticket numbers and does not have further secuirity checks like password or DOB. We need to find how the results form is retrieved. In my case AJAX. Now make http calls for all the hall-tickets using a while loop . Open a csv file and make sure all the raw-data (Source code in this case) is written into the csvfile. close the csv file. Use delimiters to divide data into different cells in any spreadsheet application. Have fun with the data. Crunch some numbers and make a few graphs!
